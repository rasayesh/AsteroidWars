## Code & Libraries Used

This project is a website designed around a game called Asteroid Wars, where users signup and make an account to play the game.
By signing up users can track their game history, and compare their scores to other players, and even chat with users that are online.
This project incorporates O.O.P to create the Asteroid Wars game, Node.js for the server, which also uses MongoDB (mongoose.js) database 
to keep track of users accounts, messages, and game data. For the front end I use HTML5/CSS3/JS that request user information from 
the server/API which gets a user request/update command and sends back or updates information stored in the database. This project has 
many java script library dependencies including: 
- Node.js - to make the js server
- Express.js - to create server API get/post/update 
- JQuery.js - make html easier to access
- Parser.js - parse JSON data being sent between server/game and website/server
- Cookie-parser.js - use cookies to keep track of logged in users and their session time
- Mongoose.js - interact with MongoDB in the Node.js server
- crypto.js - salt and hash user passwords that are stored in database for protection from malicious users/hackers
- Howler.js - used to add sound in the Asteroid Wars game


## Website/Game API

The website that includes the game, communicates with the server which has access to the Mongo database to either update the database or fetch data requested by the front end for the user to see. Examples of information requested, and updated/added include:
- user profiles
- user game history
- user scores
- user messages 
- user cookies/sessions
and more...

To communicate with the database directly the API/Server I made uses mongoose.js which stores the user profile information, game information, and user messages information.
